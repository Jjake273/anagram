The majority of my time was spent on downloading and learning the technologies and frameworks.
I used the vue.js template that they provide upon first download request.
The console currently accepts input, but does little else.
I've continued on in this project, trying to do things outside the vue.js template (little by little), and will be posting that progress in a folder labeled "SCRABBLE".
